What if Bengali had a full phonetic writing system? How would it be? Recently we found out that we need only 26 characters to write Bangla phonetically. It's just an experiment and since no one has seen Bangla transliteration like this it will seem weird to people. But exploration know no boundary, that's why exploration's "no"s know boundary.
